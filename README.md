## Usage

### ES Modules in Node

I use ECMAScript Modules in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error.

### Env Variables

Create a .env file in then root and add the following

```

NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = your mongodb uri
JWT_SECRET = 'your jwt secret'

```
### Install Dependencies

```

npm install

```
### Run
```

# Run Server

npm run server

```
### Build & Deploy

```

# Create prod build

npm run build

```

There is a Heroku postbuild script, so if you push to Heroku, no need to build manually for deployment to Heroku

### Seed Database

You can use the following commands to seed the database with some sample users and products as well as destroy all data


```

# Import data
npm run data:import

# Destroy data
npm run data:destroy

```

### Sample User Logins


```

admin@example.com (Admin)
123456

john@example.com (User)
123456

jane@example.com (User)
123456

```

### postman
the best way to use it, is with postman :
